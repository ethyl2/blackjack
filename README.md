#Sweet and Simple Blackjack with jQuery

https://ethyl2.github.io/blackjack/

---------------------------

This is a straightforward game of [Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack).

I started with code presented in Head First jQuery and modified it
to include more features: a modal with rules, a dealer's hand to compare with the player's hand,
and an ongoing score display as multiple games are played.

I also added more objects and
more functionality to the objects in the JavaScript code.

The original code can be found here in the material for chapter 6:
